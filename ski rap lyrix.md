i ain't here for that clout.
i ain't here for the glitter an' glow.
i ain't here for the flash an' show.
i ain't here tryin' to get some fame.
i don't care if y'all know my name.
i do what i want how i like it.
i don't like the fanatics one bit,
'cuz i'm smol brain.
the real no name.
why y'all lazy?
why y'all crazy?
lack of maturity is appallin'
i hear the votes callin'
hung up an' ghosted.
your ego roasted.
my skills boasted.
your immaturity noted.
my legend GOATed.
my mouth loaded
this ain't cap.
bet ya life ik how to rap.
i be the hare who took a nap.
been sleepin' for ages.
y'all still stuck in your cages.
thinkin' you be better sometime soon.
thinkin' you be better 'round noon.
your work ethic singin' a different tune.
i still win. dominate 'cuz i can.
watch your dreams fall like sand.
watch your hopes dash like that hare.
took you long enough to scare.
spin yourself a web of lies.
luv to make y'all cry.
idk what i'm doin'.
code don't mean yellin'.
but 'em lies keep spinnin'.
didn't need a foot in the door, 'cuz you left it wide open.
see my dope talent an' yk where i'm goin'.
have a seat. i'd rather stand.
what world do you live in where you think you can demand
my attention an' claim i'm an aimless fool?
mate, in this world, i set the rules.
look at my crack code an' tell me i ain't the best
took me a year to be the greatest.
this dude ain't goin' places, he's already there.
grab a seat, get a drink, pull up a chair.
brace yourself to watch me tear
your pride apart.
taught myself this far.
don't need no car.
to drive this ego 'round.
gotta luv that hatin' sound.
hundreds of fans in tow.
g-g-go beast mode.
tell me your fav program, i'll beat it.
thinkin' your better? tell your pride he can be seated.
don't charge a thin' to put you where you belong, it's free.
see those apostrophes an' yk it's me.
the one an' only legend ski.
ego can't be tamed.
legend can't be named.
skill can't be matched.
pride still intact.
claim someone else is your fav?
my, you're awfully brave.
can't code? let's have a chat.
can't spit? let's rethink that.
months ago, y'all didn't know who i was.
now knowin' ski is all the buzz.
off the charts happy i'm so gay (what?)
i ain't straight. yes, no, maybe, my name's Kate.
yeah, yeah, been a minute since i spit like this
gotta tell ya i don't got no drip
i been the baddest.
i been the maddest.
i been told i'm worthless.
i been told i'm soulless.
i been told to get a wife.
i been told to get a life. (heck no)
i like it the way that it is (so?)
i ain't changin' to make you happy
just some stranger, sit back while i do the rappin'.
writin' these verses at one in the morn',
but it so worth it my heart's been torn.
flow comes so natural, you think i'm skilled.
oh i'm sorry is that your ego that i killed?
