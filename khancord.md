here i am givin' 'nother go at rap.
ik you're gon' claim these lyrics are all cap.
crushin' your dreams while you take a nap.
hatin' on me? gotta give your shoulder a tap.
dig in the closet an' find that map.
to the halfway house to hell.
i feel like that would be a place that would suit y'all well.
i'm pretty pissed off right now, could you tell?
i don't write these lyrics to sell.
i write 'em to kill every ounce of hope you have left.
you take away my self-esteem an' call it righteousness; i call it theft.
ofc it's a diss.
what did y'all think this
was? just me gettin' pissed?
runs deeper, flow steeper, gatekeeper, code cheaper, real sleeper.
